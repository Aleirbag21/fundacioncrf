## A website template for grantmakers  

We built this free website template to help foundations and donor-advised-funds improve their online presence.  

If you have a site that was built over three years ago you're in the right place. The template is fully responsive and can be hosted (and maintained) for no cost.  

#### Screenshots

The project has two primary goals:

1. **Simple**  

  - This template is powerful but can also be used by funders of any size. If you don't have much information to share (yet!), that's ok. The template can grow as your public information grows.  

  - Of interest to family foundations, we chose a technology stack that is robust enough to handle a major foundation's traffic, yet is well within reach of the young hacker in your family.  

1. **Open**  
  - This template is 100% open source.   

  - For smaller foundations, it's meant to be 100% maintenance free.  
   
#### Purpose  

Our mission at [SmarterGiving](https://smartergiving.org) is to advance the openness of the philanthropic world through accessible technology.  

We want to make it as simple as possible to share whatever grantmaking information you're comfortable sharing.  

#### Future  

We're actively working on integrating historically popular grant specs like Foundation Center's [hGrant](http://foundationcenter.org/grantmakers/hgrant.html) while pushing those standards to incorporate the realities of the modern funder.  

## Usage  

For those familiar with Jekyll and Github Pages (or our current crush [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)), the template is fully compatible with the `github-pages` gem (no plugins, etc).  

For everyone else, detailed instructions coming soon!
